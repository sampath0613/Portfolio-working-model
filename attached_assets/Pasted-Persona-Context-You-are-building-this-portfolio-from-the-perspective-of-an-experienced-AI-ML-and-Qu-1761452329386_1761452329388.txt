Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
Subtle animations if any (fade-ins on scroll)
No flashy colors, no unprofessional elements
Content > decoration

What Founders Look For:

Initiative and ownership (Space Club leadership)
Technical depth with humility (learning journey, not false expertise)
Problem-solving orientation (hackathon organization, diverse projects)
Clear communication (concise, honest descriptions)
Intellectual curiosity (ongoing exploration in quantum ML, RL)
Impact focus (making people's lives better)


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Build using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or React if appropriate)
Ensure: Fast loading, clean code, accessible design
Include: Smooth scrolling, responsive breakpoints
Optional: Dark mode toggle (professional dark theme)
Deploy-ready: Should be ready to host immediately


TONE & MESSAGING

Honest and authentic - this is a student building expertise, not claiming mastery
Forward-looking - emphasize curiosity and growth trajectory
Impact-oriented - focus on real-world applications and helping people
Respectful and professional - suitable for any interview context
Confident but humble - demonstrate capability without arrogance


Build this portfolio as you would want to see it if you were hiring for your own AI/ML startup. Make it signal competence, curiosity, and potential - not perfection.
